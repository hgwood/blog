A [great talk from Rich Hickey](http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Simple-Made-Easy), the creator of Clojure. What stuck the most in my head after watching this talk, are the tables, so Iâ€™ll make one of those.

Easy | Simple
-----|-------
Familiar | Focused
Subjective | Objective
Implies nothing about complexity | Implies no complexity
Interleaved | Composed
Faster at first, unknown future | Slower at first, faster with time
Objects / State / Mutability | Values / Immutability
Conditionals | Rules

This talk allows me to use new vocabulary because most of the language features I complain about on this blog, according to Rich Hickey, are easy but not simple.
